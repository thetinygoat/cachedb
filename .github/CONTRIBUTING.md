# Code Style
All code should be formatted with `goimports`. For vscode you can install the `go` extension and it will handle everything for you. Code should follow code style suggested by `golint`.

# Building
Run `go build` to build cachedb. This command will generate a binary named `cachedb` in the same directory.
